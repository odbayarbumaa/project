# Robot Arm
# The project is fully functionable, but is still being worked on to improve precision, detection, user friendly interface, and more available features. 
# Below is a link to watch the robot and the code in action!

Summary: 
This project uses a robot arm with 12 degrees of mechanical freedom. The robot arm and the camera are programmed in separate .py files. 

Purpose: 
To create an fully functional robot arm that can detect objects x and y coordinates (z-coordinates can be easily implementd), detect the objects shape, detect the objects color, and then sort the object into bins. 

Notes: 
Everything in this project is very malleable, meaning that everything is dynamic except the location of the bins which has fixed location points on the grid coordinates.
